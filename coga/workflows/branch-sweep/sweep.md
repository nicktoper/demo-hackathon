## sweep

Script step. Runs `coga/branch-sweep/sweep`, which calls
`coga.branchsweep.sweep_branches`: enumerate local and `origin` branches,
skip `main`, the checked-out branch, and any branch recorded on a
not-`done` ticket, then delete the rest when GitHub confirms (by branch
name and current tip SHA) a merged PR with no open PR. The command exits
successfully when there is nothing to delete.
