## Description

First-run onboarding. One scripted question — "What do you want to build?" —
then an agent-led chat draws out the rest, ending in a short vision you sign off
on and a flat batch of draft tickets you can immediately `coga launch`. Empty
repos only; no scan. Launching this ticket starts the chat.

## Context

Empty until the `gather-and-spec` step runs at first launch — the agreed vision
is written to `coga/contexts/product/vision/SKILL.md` and raw intake notes
stay on the blackboard.

<!-- coga:blackboard -->

The blackboard is a notepad for the human and agent to use while working
through this task. For onboarding it holds the raw intake from the
gather-and-spec chat — the working notes behind the vision, which stay here
rather than in the durable `contexts/product/vision` doc.
