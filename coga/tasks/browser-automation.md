## Description

Turn a described browser task into a working Playwright automation. This ticket runs the build-automation methodology end to end, then emits and launches a concrete tier-bound automation ticket that executes it. The plug-and-play entry point: launch it, give it the task, get a working automation.

## Context

Generalizes browser-automation creation so anyone can go from a plain-English task to a working automation with no bespoke setup. The methodology lives in the build-automation workflow; the how (CLI commands, snapshot-first, fail-loud) in browser/playwright; the approach gate and DOM standard in browser/api-first and browser/dom-backed. Output is one of the three run tiers (fully-automated / human-verify / human-only) wired to the discovered plan. Provide the task as the first turn after launch (coga launch takes a slug, not free text, so the agent takes the task at start).

The blackboard is a notepad to be written to often as the human and agent works through a task.
