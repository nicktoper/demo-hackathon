## Description

Post a single Slack digest focused on outcomes: Done tickets from the spool
plus other commits merged to `origin/main` since the last digest run.

Routine lifecycle chatter (`coga create`, message-less `bump`, `mark
active/paused`, `retire`, successful recurring creates) does not enter Slack.
Done tickets and recurring scan errors append one JSONL record to the dedicated
`spool.md` file (its `## Spool (pending)` section) — see
`coga.notification.notify`. Once a day this ticket fires on its schedule and
its script step runs `coga digest`, which:

1. reads the unconsumed Done/error records (a merge-by-construction spool, not a lock),
2. fetches `origin/main` and scans commits since `### Digest State` `last_commit`
   (first run falls back to the last 24 hours),
3. attributes merge commits to Done tickets by matching PR numbers,
4. filters Coga's own state-sync commits out of "Also merged",
5. posts one sectioned message to the shared channel,
6. advances the spool watermark, trimming the consumed prefix and keeping the
   newest record as an anchor (so a concurrent producer append never conflicts), and
7. updates `### Digest State` with the new high-water mark.

Genuinely urgent events (`coga block`, script-step failures, the
manual `coga slack` FYI) bypass the spool and still post live, so a stuck
agent or a failure never waits a day to be seen.

An empty spool is not automatically a no-op: merged commits can still produce
the "Also merged (no ticket)" section. The run posts nothing only when there
are no Done records, no recurring errors, and no post-filter new commits. The
spool and high-water mark are real, git-tracked, human-readable state — never
hidden state — so the queue and scan boundary are always legible.

## Context

<!-- coga:blackboard -->

The blackboard is a notepad to be written to often as the human and agent works through a task.
